Project Desicription: 
            - The team was tasked with developing a virtual reality software to monitor satellite constellations within an Oculus VR headset.
            
            - The team developed a complex software to satisfy the requirements of the project. The software is capable of recieving real-time 
              data from a ground station, parsing TLEs, performing simulation analyzation, and visualizing complex data in 2 & 3 dimensions.
              
Assets Used:
            - Unity 3D
